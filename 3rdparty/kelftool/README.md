Clone commit hash 6b9b471388626c4a576c7d7d67b8664c00fcd024 from kelftool repository into this folder and apply patch using `git apply --unidiff-zero kelftool_u0.patch` to make it usable.

NOTE: This does not cover a lot of usages for KELFs or MagicGate. It is just enough to get Python 2 games to run ONLY.
